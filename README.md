## üí≠ Process

- I started creating a Database at Mongo Atlas and populate with Shaman King datas from Wiki
- I creating all the basic server features and implementing all shaman features (Model, Controller and Router) to test.
- I connected the server to Atlas database.
- I implementende all other features to:
  - Spirits
  - Tools
  - Animes
  - Mangas
  - Games
- I deployed the server at Render.

## üìö Learnings

The learning objective of this project was to develop an API to learn about RESTful API and also to provide an extensive source of data related to Shaman King franchise. I learned about back-end development with Node.js, RESTful API and database management. I also learned how to deploy an database with Mongo Atlas an servers with Renser.
